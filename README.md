# c-plus-plus-learning
I have started learning C++ through [codecademy](https:www.codecademy.com).

This repository contains some of the various coding challenges I have done in the C++ course.

In addition, I have added my own improvements to the base challenge code for fun and more experimentation.

## Coding Challenges
### UFO Hangman Game (CLI)
- This is a CLI based game similar to hangman, but with each incorrect guess, the stick figure gets pulled further into a tractor beam.
- Improvements made include ...
    - Codeword is randomly picked from a vector of strings
    - Codewords can now be phrases (include spaces)
    - Codeword displayed at end if player wins **or** loses
    - Guessed letters are case-insensitive
    - Player can play more than once
    - Prevents player from guessing a previously guessed letter
