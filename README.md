# c-plus-plus-learning
I have started learning C++ through [codecademy](https:www.codecademy.com).

This repository contains some of the various coding challenges I have done in the C++ course.

In addition, I have added my own improvements to the base challenge code for fun and more experimentation.

## Coding Projects
### UFO Hangman Game (Functions Project)
- This is a CLI based game similar to hangman, but with each incorrect guess, the stick figure gets pulled further into a tractor beam.
- Improvements made include ...
    - Codeword is randomly picked from a vector of strings
    - Codewords can be phrases (include spaces)
    - Codeword displayed at end if player wins **or** loses
    - Guessed letters are case-insensitive
    - Player can play more than once
    - Prevents player from guessing a previously guessed letter

### Tic-Tac-Toe (Functions Challenge Project)
- This is a CLI based tic-tac-toe implementation.
- Code challenge requirements were as follows:
    - Use a `for` loop or `while` loop to iterate through the player turns.
    - Use a vector or an array to hold nine positions of the 3x3 grid.
    - Use functions to make the program modular.
- These requirements have been met in my implementation finished on 7/20.
- I have plans to add more features to this program once I finish the rest of the course.
